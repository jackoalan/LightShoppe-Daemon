         ********** WORK IN PROGRESS SOFTWARE!!! **********

This is the web-based frontend for LightShoppe-Daemon.
It utilises HTML5, JavaScript, and SVG to provide a graphical representation
and UI for manipulating the state of a LightShoppe server using its JSON
RPC.

By default, LightShoppe-Daemon accepts connections on port 9196. The static
HTML, JavaScript, and image files are served independently of the Daemon.
Currently, the Daemon will only honour requests made with the absolute path
"/lsdnew". This may be changed in CoreRPC.c, but will be made 
user-configurable eventually. 

In order to set up a server to run the LightShoppe web client, a web server
is required with proxy support. Apache's or Lighttpd's mod_proxy both will
work. Place the contents of LightShoppe-web somewhere readable by the web
server's user and use its path in the server's configuration as shown below.




I use Lighttpd with a configuration like the following:

alias.url += ( "/lsdnew/plugins" => "<PATH TO LIGHTSHOPPE-DAEMON'S PLUGINS DIRECTORY>" )

$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/lsdnew" {
  alias.url += ( "/lsdnew" => "<PATH TO LIGHTSHOPPE-WEB>" )

  auth.backend = "htdigest"
  auth.backend.htdigest.userfile = "<PATH TO HTDIGEST>"
  auth.require = (
    "" => (
      "method"  => "digest",
      "realm"   => "Light Server",
      "require" => "valid-user"
    )
  )


  proxy.server = (
    "/lsdnew/main/" => (
      (
        "host" => "127.0.0.1",
        "port" => 9196
      )
    )
  )
}




You may remove the auth entries if you don't need HTTP authentication.

Apache instructions coming soon!
